Purpose of Licensing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Imperfect Collection* loader includes a built-in **licensing system**
originally designed as its revenue source. Although the project is now intended
to be provided **free of charge** only relying on donations, the licensing 
mechanism remains active to preserve its **unique registration structure** and
ensure:

- Each copy of Imperfect Collection remains **unique and traceable**.
- **Game transference** between separate copies is prevented, avoiding
  unauthorized distribution of game files.
- The loader continues serving its archival purpose **without enabling piracy**.

This approach respects the intellectual property of the original games while
allowing preservation and enjoyment within each licensed machine.

Licensing Procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To license your Imperfect Collection installation, follow these steps.

1. **Gather Required Information**

   You will need:

   - A **Name**: up to **20 characters long** (letters, numbers, or simple symbols). 
     This will be shown as the license holder’s name.
   - The **Hard Disk Serial Number**, which is:

     - Displayed in the loader’s main menu footer.  
     - Printed on the actual hard disk label (e.g., Toshiba MQ01ABD100, Serial **123456789**).

   .. note::

      If you are unable to locate or read the serial number directly, the system
      provides an alternative method described below.

2. **Creating a License Request File**

   If you do not have a valid license file yet:

   - Insert a **USB stick formatted in FAT32** into the MK machine.
   - Access the **Settings menu** by pressing the Service button.
   - Select **USB System Registration**.

   The system will generate a file named **`request.txt`** on your USB stick.
   This file contains all necessary registration details.

3. **Submitting Your Request**

   - Send the generated `request.txt` file to the licensing contact
     (currently NTDEC, or via a future licensing web page).

4. **Receiving Your License File**

   After processing your request, you will receive a file named **`license.txt`**.

5. **Installing the License**

   - Place the received `license.txt` into the root of a **FAT32-formatted USB stick**.
   - Insert the USB stick into the MK machine.
   - Go to the **Settings menu** and select **USB System Registration** again.

6. **Verification**

   After successful registration:

   - The system will display your chosen **Name** in place of “UNLICENSED”.
   - The **“By”** field will update to show the licenser name (e.g., **NTDEC**).

   This confirms that your installation is now licensed and fully operational.

Re-Licensing Warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    If you choose to **re-license your system** using a different `license.txt`
    file (for example, to change the name or migrate licenses, or use another hard disk):

    - **There is a risk of losing all installed games and settings.**
    - This will **force a complete reinstallation** and re-import of all game data.

    Only perform re-licensing if absolutely necessary, and ensure you have backed
    up all critical data before proceeding.

There are special licenses that allow the migration of data totally safe between
hard disks, but those are locked behind **donation percs**. If you choose to
support us, this feature will be available.

^^^^^

By completing this process, you ensure your loader operates under its intended
preservation framework while respecting the anti-piracy measures that protect
these historic titles.
