please contact the author.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The **Other Games Importer** allows users to **transfer games directly between
two Imperfect Collection installations**. This feature is particularly useful
for setting up multiple systems efficiently without needing to repeat individual
disk-based imports for each game.

Licensing Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Important:**

- **Only users with a full (non-free) license** can use this feature.
- **Free licenses do not support game transfers**.
- Why? We do not support piracy.

Feature Description

The Other Games Importer enables:

- **Direct transfer of games** from one Imperfect Collection installation to
  another.
- **Two operational modes:**
  - Copy **only the currently selected game**.
  - Copy **all available games** from the source system.

1. **Boot into Imperfect Collection.**

   - Ensure you are logged in with a **full (non-free) license**.

2. **Connect the source Imperfect Collection system.**

   - Use the appropriate connection interface to link both systems.
   - The importer will automatically detect the connected Imperfect Collection
     containing the games to copy.

3. **Navigate to the settings menu.**

   - Select **The Game Transfer Feature!! (A.K.A Import)**.

4. **Choose the desired game.**

   - Select **any game** from the settings menu list.

5. **Select transfer mode when prompted.**

   - If another Imperfect Collection is detected, you will be asked:

     - **“Copy only this game?”** (Red buttons)
       - Select to transfer **only the selected game**.

     - **“Copy all games?”** (Center button)
       - Select to transfer **all available games** from the connected source.

6. **Begin the transfer process.**

   - The importer will copy the selected game(s) from the connected Imperfect
     Collection to your system.
   - Progress will be displayed on screen.

7. **Wait for completion and reboot.**

   - After the transfer is complete, the system will **reboot automatically**.
   - All copied games will appear in the game menu.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **No source system detected:**
  - Ensure the Imperfect Collection system is connected properly. Connect it
    **after** the destinated Imperfect Collection already booted.
  - Verify cable integrity and connection interface compatibility.

- **Feature unavailable:**
  - Confirm you are using a **full license**.
  - Visit **[https://www.patreon.com/ckdur](https://www.patreon.com/ckdur)** to
    upgrade if needed.

- **Transfer fails midway:**
  - Reconnect both systems and retry the transfer.
  - Check storage space availability on the target system.

Additional Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- This feature significantly reduces deployment times when **multiple systems
  require identical game sets**.
- Always ensure the **source system has verified working games** before
  initiating the transfer to avoid propagating corrupted data.
